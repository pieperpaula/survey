# survey
For Kukesh


The first piece of data needed is a list of styles. This would replace the three current style codes that are in the list "styles" on page 13. I think for testing it can be any upcoming styles. Maybe if you can filter so that they are around class 2/3/4 so that they are not really high heat or really low heat. From this list, the script pulls two random styles to show a user. 

The second piece of data needed could be the names of the shoes to display with them, but honestly this is as not as important, but I may A/B test this to see if it changes any results. 

For the backend data, I hope to have an anonymized user id, the two shoes they were shown and which shoe was clicked by the user.
